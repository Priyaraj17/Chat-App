Code Challenge


I developed a real-time chat-application using socket.io, Node.js and Express with Vanilla.js on the frontend.


Server.js:


* I started with setting up the server for the application and installed all the npm  packages such as express, socket.io etc. Socket.io is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event based connection between the browser and server


  

  



  





* As soon as the client connects to the server, two messages are broadcasted to the chat room.


   * “Welcome to ChatCord”.
   * “Alex has joined the chat”.


  



* When a client leaves the chat, a message is broadcasted that a user has left the chat.


User.js:


* I created a separate file for users which handles all the functionalities of a user such as joining the server, leaving the server, getting the current user etc.


* For the challenge, instead of using databases, I stored the user information in an array called users.
* Every time a new user enters a chatroom, an object is created which contains the information : username, id, room. This object is then pushed to the users array.


  



Main.js:


It is the client side javascript file which acts as an interface between the server and the user. 
* Outputs the message to the DOM.


  



* Add room names and usernames to the DOM.
